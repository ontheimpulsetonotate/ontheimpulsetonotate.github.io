They are made partners and opponents of one another. They tend to work best in comparison. \nI am reminded of a talk by Masha Gessen [1], which they performed upon receipt of the Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thought late last year. In it, they emphasize the role that acts of comparison play in our current socio-­political landscape, an act we undertake to enrich our knowledge of the world, an act that serves our basic experience of that world. \u201CA feeling is a feeling only if you have experienced other feelings,\u201D Gessen says. \nWhile useful to a large extent, there are occasions when comparisons can do more harm than good, she argues, pointing specifically to Gaza. In this context, society appears to have been convinced that dates in history are round and square marks in time, rather than nebulous containers for multiplicitous shapes and forms. At the end of Gessen\u2019s speech, they bring to mind two recurrent phrases by the Russian writer Valeria Narbikova [2], whose novella they translated a number of years prior. The first phrase is a plea for a comparison\u200A\u2014\u200A\u201CIf there is something, then what\u2019s it like?\u201D The second contextualizes that plea\u200A\u2014\u200A\u201CSomething always precedes that which follows.\u201D \nHowever innocent it might be, the act of comparing two things means comparing their \u201Ccontexts and histories.\u201D It means making some sort of prediction, whether concrete or absent-minded. It means seeing through time, both backwards and forwards. When we compare, we are often blind to these facts.

The former is the first thing we can see; it clarifies certain qualities of space and concretizes notions of difference. In looking outward, Berger writes, \u201CThe eye of the other combines with our own eye to make it fully credible that we are part of the visible world.\u201D \nThis visibility inspires us to communicate with one another. We acquire words; we perform those words with voice; we give that voice points of inflection.\nIt is near impossible to outline where and when these acquisitions begin in our personal narratives. I know that my voice developed potency in the presence of my family, and within the environments where we gathered to share stories. Primary among these is the site of my grandparents\u2019 home in Maine, lodged between trees, hovering above a lake. It is this site\u2019s function as a locus of belonging which makes otherwise fleeting moments indelible. It is its natural contours, which follow me, wherever I go and for however long. Multiple generations of my family find and call this place home. This enduring force of connection is what grants it credibility. \nI often return to my family archives [2] to secure this force. I repeatedly navigate 8mm film shot throughout the sixties and seventies. Inside each roll are soft captures of the landscape, of its blue surfaces reflecting and refracting the light, of my youthful grandparents moving through time, just above the water. I gravitate toward these images because I know I belong inside them. "},{"v":"[1] Berger, John\r. Ways of Seeing. Based on the 1972\rBBC Television Series of the same\rname.

In just the same fashion, we have built and buoyed our economies upon formulated units of measure. These agreements are often established in writing, through the application of systematized models composed of hyper-­specific notational styles.\nA ruler is one among many of the devices a designer uses to measure and count, to bring specificity to the contours and edges of a thing. A ruler measures distance\u200A\u2014\u200Athe amount of space separating one thing and another or the amount of space occupied by one thing and another. Distance implies duration\u200A\u2014\u200Athe length of time it takes to travel between one space and the next. It is here that the lines between our qualitative and quantitative counts begin to blur. \nI  designed a collection of rulers and stencils [1] as a method of turning \u201Ccount-ability\u201D on its side. This collection demonstrates the contradictions inherent to the act of measuring one thing in particular\u200A\u2014\u200Athe qualitative components of stories. Stories, of course, give our lives formal attachments; they create and establish meaning. Their narrative pace, measurable length, and duration grant them certain classifications. There is the hero\u2019s journey, the Cinderella story, and the rule of threes. To define a set of narrative structures, as we have done throughout linguistic history, is to allow for a transparent wlook at the manner in which meaning is made. Perhaps this transparency enriches one\u2019s eventual propensity for storytelling. Perhaps, instead, it limits one\u2019s ability to see beyond the surface, narrowing the potential for new forms to fill in the gaps.\nTo interact with these \u201Cartifacts\u201D is to encounter a phenomenon well described by James Bridle [2] in his book Ways of Being\u200A\u2014\u200A\u201Cthe more forcefully we interrogate and attempt to classify the world, the more unclassifiable it becomes.\u201D"},{"v":"[2] Bridle, James.

Early on, I describe it as \u201Cwading through water\u201D\u200A\u2014\u200AI move and shift through content with a relative sense of control; I am careful not to dive in too quickly. \nLater into my graduate studies, I feel I should honor the tenacity that characterizes this movement. The habit I have of picking up and caring for too many things along the way sometimes feels urgent and instinctive; I am concerned with minor details; I am often aware of cause and effect. It was the latter part of January when I encountered in Webster\u2019s 1913 Dictionary [1] a descriptor for \u201Ccare\u201D that I had not yet before. And just for a short period of time, the phrase \u201Cwatchful attention\u201D replaces my early metaphor. \nSome months later, I am searching again, hoping to characterize my efforts to aggregate time-honored evidence by the additive collections they produce. At this time, the alliterative phrase \u201Cartifactual accumulations \u201D [2] forms in my mind\u200A\u2014\u200Ait titles the first container I design to house the ideological frames of my thesis. Here, I weave back and forth through personal narrative and present preoccupations. Here, I accumulate artifacts of these stories, and perform them on the page. \nHowever suitable this latest framework, I do not feel compelled to halt my search. I continue amassing and sifting, collecting and constructing. I lean on theorist-poets, on writers of nonfiction and practitioners of critical theory. I make long lists of quotes\u200A\u2014\u200AI isolate couplets and quartets of words from them; I isolate sentences. These lists keep growing.

Perhaps like parataxis, he writes, \u201CA list always leaves something to be invented or recalled, something forgotten in the moment of its making.\u201D In this way, a list suggests forms of continuity rooted in the past and knotted somewhere in the future. In the reading of a list, a satisfying quality of exhaustion is made present; in its making, a particular resistance to the use of placeholders; and in its application, an array of potential interpretations.\nLists have become essential artifacts of my process. They exist in many forms\u200A\u2014\u200Aas navigational tools in google docs like the one that preceded the design of this book, as rows and columns in color-coded spreadsheets that embed themselves into web-based code, as haphazard lines etched onto the white planes of tabloid printer paper. I think this habit lives parallel to the desire to jog the memory with a certain frequency. I think a list performs a precision that its contents often lack.\nJonathan Mark Jackson [2] affirms this idea for me when he describes his own relationship to listmaking.

In Michael Warner\u2019s [1] \u201CPublics and Counterpublics,\u201D its referent deepens in complexity. He describes a public here as \u201Cthe social space created by the reflexive circulation of discourse.\u201D This suggests that a public relies on shared collectives of knowledge, but that the imagined scope of circulation could be near to infinite. He makes the case for the rise of counterpublics by highlighting the dominant public\u2019s reliance on stylization\u200A\u2014\u200Aa counterpublic typically has a conflictual relation with this mode of discourse; it evolves a collective of strangers less quick to assume universalities; it honors the presence of difference. \nIn its attempt to confirm or refute the build up of bias, my work often turns away from personal experience. It looks to open up participatory sites for encounters, where wanting to know something and say something of the self feels particular and collective, all at once.\nI devote a long winter to this understanding. This is by way of a series of letters [2] I write to extend personal gratitudes to my community. These community members reach far and wide, but holistically compose the minds and hearts I have relied on for progressive periods of my becoming. They are my aunts and uncles; they are old teachers, coaches, and teammates; they are friends from childhood, high school and college; they are present colleagues and new collaborators in thought; they are happy excuses to reach out for the experience of reflexivity. \nIn the span of four weeks, I composed more than sixty letters\u200A\u2014\u200Aeach one expressing my thanks for their contributions to an online archive of stories recently published for an adjacent project. Alongside individually addressed letters, I enclose a collection of terms, a text reference from my bookshelf, and a prompt that might evolve the conversation further. While inherently private in form, when made public, letters function quite like poems. They offer a window into a private landscape, one that\u2019s unselfconsciously composed with an eye for the other, one that\u2019s deeply rooted in parallel experiences of subjectivity. \nThe first of these letters, I address to E early into January, focusing on the quality of attention that defines her movement through the world\u2014\u201C\u200AIt\u2019s an attention that allows you to capture the finest of details in your work; an attention that brings a quiet smile to your face, a subtle laugh to a table; an attention that bestows on others a distinct confidence, in having been seen and understood; an attention that can fill ten pages of a notebook, all at once; an attention that does not overwhelm, but waits patiently to be held; an attention that leads to care, to knowing, to nuance.\u201D \nAnoher of these letters, I ship a good distance across the country, to my friend A."},{"v":"[1] Warner, Michael.

I am compelled by the spontaneous image captures that live there. They seem to signal a modern impulse against forgetting, particular to each individual curator. I ask some friends to scroll through their own phones in search of images. I ask that they share with me those containing a particular object, or objects in plural. With some, I curate the outcomes by saying, \u201CI\u2019ve been enjoying the images where ppl are holding something in hand.\u201D\nThis request produces a long slew of image replies.

They arrive separately and simultaneously; they sometimes collide with each other; at others, they collide with words. Always, they make contact with the hand, a form that controls how and what we archive, and with whom we share that archive. That hand gestures in excess throughout the video sequence, often in parallel to colliding voices. \nIt performs the act of scrolling, tapping, swiping, and thumbing through what I term \u201Cuncanny particulars,\u201D a couplet inspired by the quotation isolated at the video\u2019s beginning\u200A\u2014\u200A\u201CBeauty always takes place in the particular.\u201D [3] The refrain \u201CI have heard it said,\u201D precedes this quotation and each of the ones to follow.

The arc of its narrative varies but its composition is always the same. It resides in a world I left behind a number of years ago, but which defined me for every memorable year prior to that. This world is contained by thick white lines. It is one constrained by time. Forty-five minutes command the first half of play, another forty-five the second. This world is one with geometric edges, but a nebulous interior. It is filled with members of my team, their bodies in motion. Eleven of us are allowed to occupy its interior at any given time, each position assigned a number. Seven and eleven mark the wingers; nine the striker; ten the attacking center midfielder. We are meant to move as a networked unit, tactical in our search for minor openings.\nIn this dream, however, I stand apart from that unit. I am stuck on the sidelines searching for something else altogether\u200A\u2014\u200Athe proper gear. My cleats are lost; my socks are soaked; I have nothing to wear. It is only as the final whistle blows that I manage to pull myself together. I stand at the field\u2019s edges, ready, but too late. \nThrough a cycle of return, this dream often reads back as proof of my own longing for what\u2019s come to pass, the same way we might describe the burden of nostalgia. Our associations with the word are often somber, but a certain beauty runs parallel to that sentiment. There is something potently seductive about watching a moment unfold in plain view and lacking the ability to touch it. I think it must be this presence in my dreams which promotes the chase I feel compelled to undertake when I wake.

If we look backwards at the 1913 record of Webster\u2019s Dictionary [1], we see in its nod to \u201Csecret power\u201D an association of craft with virtuosity.\nTo perform a practice of such a repetitive quality requires not just virtue, but immeasurable space, time and discipline. This kind of rigor used to mark the craftsman with honor. But with the rise in popularity of conceptual and perceptual art forms, championed by Duchamp and his contemporaries, the art world began to devalue craft as it had been previously defined. In favor of higher intellectual value, sheer aesthetics and skill began to lose out in a competition between concept and form. \nI attempt to illuminate these falsely dichotomous relationships through a series of conversations with individuals pursuing numerous simultaneous occupations\u200A\u2014\u200Asome of them requiring rigorous engagement of the artist\u2019s and, others less obviously so. I ask, How would you describe the labor inherent to your creative practice? Does the word \u201Ccraft\u201D fall short? These engagements help to trace the etymology of the word craft  into the present\u200A\u2014\u200Athey animate its inherent tension and extend its definition into diverse disciplines, burlesque and baking among them. The resulting online collection, Notes on Craft [2], suggests that craft has many focal points, many synonyms too, and that all are far from lacking in intellect.

Here, I am permitted to read non-linearly, to make poems out of accidental encounters. Here, the book itself becomes that encounter. Here, the objectness of the graphic designer\u2019s practice can begin to move toward what designer Tereza Rullerova [1] refers to as its eventness.\nI am found contemplating the form of the book rather obsessively one spring, unpacking and expanding this container across ten different physical forms.

This is partially to discover an answer to questions about my own preoccupation with words. Perhaps, it is a way to keep from giving up on them. For a few, the \u201C why\u201D  takes shape in clear, concise terms. As Zadie Smith [2] puts it at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, \u201CIt is something to do.\u201D For others, however, coming to any sort of conclusion is preceded by a burdensome philosophical struggle; the answers appear deeply interwoven, a mess to untangle. \nThe latter is true of the Norwegian writer Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s [3] meditations in his essay \u201CInadvertent.\u201D He begins it by way of another author, whose answer to the why takes shape in a single five-word proclamation\u200A\u2014\u200A\u201CI write because I am going to die.\u201D For Knausgaard, he power of this statement resides not in its inherent truth. Instead, it is the fact of seeing the author as he says these words which grants them their flavor. It is his acknowledgment of the author\u2019s \u201Csweater tucked [unceremoniously] into his trousers,\u201D which allows the language to take on the characteristics of a piece of literature. Primary among these is the presence of distance, Knausgaard argues. In literature, we can explore the space \u201Cbetween something that is true and the setting in which truth unfolds.\u201D In literature, we can step outside ourselves to see through the imagination. \nSo the question remains for Knausgaard as it does for me\u200A\u2014\u200Awhy write when reading provides such a beautiful escape from our visible reality? Why place words into particular positions when such a plethora of arrangements have already been realized? \nMany of us begin this project to be helpful, our view of the other placed squarely at the center of the endeavor. I too tend to find this principle grounding\u200A\u2014\u200Aa fruitful start to which I can frequently return. The artist and writer Jenny Odell [4] describes the journey into her book Saving Time [5] as guided by a similar desire to make a difference, to recompose the narrative. That is, until she reaches the end of the writing process, when she admits, \u201CI felt I was writing to save my life.\u201D In a public talk some months after her book is published, she expands upon this sentiment\u200A\u2014\u200Anodding to the \u201Cnow and not now,\u201D the known and the unknown, she watches the book revive her appetite for a future tense.\n I encountered a similar sentiment in an email the writer and former Olympic swimmer Leanne Shapton returned to me late into February. I have been following her practice closely for a number of years, closest when I bid my competitive soccer career a final farewell. \u201CAthlete\u201D was my definition throughout my adolescence and college years, even beyond. And while that definition continues to be reformulated, similar questions possess my conscience. I want to know what compels Shapton to sit before a blank page and fill it with varied gradations of form, to what extent her athletic discipline informs this. \u201CIt\u2019s like an appetite or hunger,\u201D she replies.. \u201CIt needs feeding or I get grouchy and depressed.\u201D"},{"v":"[1] Gorwell, George. \u201CWhy I Write\u201D Gangrel, Summer 1946.

Under certain theoretical frameworks, I am given permission to think of words as propulsive elements in the body, sources of energy, holders of the breath. If the word has durable power, I know that it is because we have constructed that power in attempting to explain images to ourselves, and perhaps most especially, to others.\nI use the tools of my practice to cull, stretch, and recompose words. Words create images; images create words. We translate one and another to each other.
